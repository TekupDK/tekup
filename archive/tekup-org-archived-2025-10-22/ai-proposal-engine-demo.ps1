John Smith (CTO): "Hi Sarah, thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. We're really struggling with our current CRM system. It's become a major bottleneck for our sales team."

Sarah Johnson (Sales Rep): "I understand completely. What specific challenges are you facing?"

John: "Well, our current system is completely manual. Our sales team is wasting 4-5 hours every day just entering data and trying to track leads. It's incredibly inefficient and we're losing deals because of it."

Sarah: "That sounds frustrating. How is this impacting your business?"

John: "It's costing us money, Sarah. We estimate we're losing about $50,000 in potential revenue every month because our sales process is so slow. We need something that can automate our workflows and give us real-time insights."

Sarah: "I see. What's your timeline for implementing a solution?"

John: "We need this done ASAP. Our board is pushing for Q1 results and we can't afford to wait. Ideally, we'd like to have something in place within 6-8 weeks."

Sarah: "And what's your budget range for this project?"

John: "We've allocated around $75,000 for the right solution. We're not looking for the cheapest option - we want something that will actually solve our problems and give us a good ROI."

Sarah: "That makes sense. Have you looked at any other solutions?"

John: "We've evaluated Salesforce and HubSpot, but they seem too complex for our needs. We want something more streamlined and easier to use."

Sarah: "I understand. Well, I think we have exactly what you're looking for..."
