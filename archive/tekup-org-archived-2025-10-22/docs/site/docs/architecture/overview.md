# Architecture Overview

The TekUp platform is designed as a comprehensive AI-powered business ecosystem that operates as a living, breathing organism. This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture and design principles.

## System Design Philosophy

### Living AI Organism
The platform is designed to function as a unified AI organism where:
- **Applications communicate seamlessly** through standardized APIs and event systems
- **AI components learn and adapt** based on usage patterns and business metrics
- **Self-monitoring and optimization** occurs automatically across all services
- **Intelligent decision-making** happens at every layer of the stack

### Core Principles

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Loosely coupled, independently deployable services
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Asynchronous messaging for scalability and resilience
3. **Multi-Tenant by Design**: Complete data isolation with shared infrastructure
4. **API-First Development**: All functionality exposed through well-documented APIs
5. **Security by Default**: Zero-trust security model with comprehensive monitoring

### Multi-Tenant Data Model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    TENANT {
        uuid id PK
        string name
        string domain
        jsonb settings
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    
    USER {
        uuid id PK
        uuid tenant_id FK
        string email
        string role
        jsonb permissions
        timestamp created_at
    }
    
    APPLICATION_DATA {
