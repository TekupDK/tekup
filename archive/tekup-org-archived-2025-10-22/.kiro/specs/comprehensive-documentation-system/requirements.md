6. WHEN considering technology choices THEN there SHALL be technology decision records (ADRs)

### Requirement 6: Living Documentation System

**User Story:** As a system user, I want documentation that stays current and evolves with the system so that information is always accurate and relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN documentation SHALL be automatically updated where possible
2. WHEN APIs evolve THEN OpenAPI specs SHALL be regenerated and validated
3. WHEN new features are added THEN documentation templates SHALL guide proper documentation
4. IF documentation becomes outdated THEN automated checks SHALL flag inconsistencies
5. WHEN documentation is accessed THEN usage analytics SHALL inform content optimization
6. WHEN system behavior changes THEN AI SHALL suggest documentation updates

### Requirement 7: Multi-Language Support

**User Story:** As a Danish business user, I want documentation available in Danish so that I can effectively use the platform in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing user-facing documentation THEN it SHALL be available in both Danish and English
2. WHEN using business applications THEN UI text SHALL support Danish localization
3. WHEN reading technical documentation THEN core concepts SHALL have Danish translations
4. IF errors occur THEN error messages SHALL be localized appropriately

6. WHEN AI provides insights THEN they SHALL be delivered in the user's preferred language

### Requirement 8: API Keys and External Service Management

**User Story:** As a developer or system administrator, I want comprehensive management of API keys and external service integrations so that all services can authenticate and communicate securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up applications THEN there SHALL be centralized API key management with secure storage
2. WHEN integrating external services THEN there SHALL be documented API endpoints, authentication methods, and rate limits
3. WHEN API keys expire or rotate THEN there SHALL be automated notification and rotation procedures
