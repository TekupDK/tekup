# CRM System for Tekup Platform

## Overview

The Tekup platform already has a lead management system, but lacks comprehensive CRM functionality. This document outlines the design for a new CRM system that would integrate with the existing Tekup ecosystem, extending the current lead management capabilities with full customer relationship management features.

The CRM system would be built as a new application within the Tekup monorepo, leveraging existing shared packages and following the established architectural patterns. It would work alongside the existing `tekup-lead-platform` and `flow-api` to provide a complete customer relationship management solution.

The CRM interface would seamlessly integrate with the existing Tekup design language, using the same Tailwind CSS configuration, color palette, and component patterns as the current `flow-web` application. This ensures consistency across all Tekup applications and provides a unified user experience.

The CRM ecosystem would function as an integral part of the Tekup platform, connecting with all existing applications to provide a seamless workflow from lead capture to customer relationship management. The system is designed with multi-tenancy at its core, supporting isolated data and customized experiences for each tenant (Rendetalje, Foodtruck Fiesta, and Tekup).

    subgraph External Access
        F
        G
        H
    end
```

### Component Architecture

The CRM system would consist of the following components:

1. **CRM API Service** - Backend service built with NestJS, following the same patterns as existing services
2. **CRM Web UI** - Next.js frontend application
3. **CRM Mobile App** - React Native mobile application (extension of existing mobile apps)
4. **Shared Packages** - Extensions to existing shared packages for CRM-specific types and utilities

### Integration with Existing Apps

The CRM system would integrate seamlessly with all existing Tekup applications:

1. **flow-api**: The CRM API would communicate with flow-api to access existing lead data and tenant information. When a lead is converted in the CRM, it would update the status in flow-api.

2. **tekup-lead-platform**: The CRM would consume qualified leads from the lead platform and provide feedback on conversion rates and sales outcomes.

3. **flow-web**: The existing web interface would be extended to include CRM functionality, with navigation to CRM modules.

4. **inbox-ai**: The desktop application could display CRM contacts and deals related to email conversations.

5. **tekup-mobile**: The mobile app would include CRM functionality for field sales teams to access contact information and update deal statuses.

6. **nexus-dashboard**: The admin dashboard would include CRM metrics and reports.

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

The CRM system would follow the same multi-tenant architecture as the existing Tekup platform, providing isolated data and customized experiences for each tenant:

1. **Tenant Isolation**: Each tenant (Rendetalje, Foodtruck Fiesta, Tekup) would have completely isolated data
2. **Custom Branding**: Each tenant can have custom branding, colors, and logos
3. **Tenant-specific Workflows**: Custom business processes and validation rules per tenant
4. **Independent Configuration**: Each tenant can configure CRM settings independently
5. **Resource Allocation**: Fair resource distribution across tenants

### Ecosystem Workflow

The CRM system would create a unified workflow across the entire Tekup ecosystem for each tenant:

1. **Lead Capture**: Leads enter through various channels (website forms, email, social media) and are processed by flow-api
2. **Lead Qualification**: Qualified leads are enriched and scored by tekup-lead-platform
3. **Lead Conversion**: Sales teams convert qualified leads to CRM contacts, companies, and deals through the CRM interface
4. **Relationship Management**: Ongoing customer relationships are managed through CRM contacts, activities, and deals
5. **Communication**: Email interactions in inbox-ai are linked to CRM contacts and deals
6. **Mobile Access**: Field sales teams access CRM data through tekup-mobile
7. **Analytics**: Business metrics are reported through nexus-dashboard with CRM data integration

### Integration Points

- **flow-api**: For existing lead data and tenant management
- **tekup-lead-platform**: For advanced lead qualification and nurturing
- **@tekup/shared**: For shared types and utilities
- **@tekup/api-client**: For API communication
- **@tekup/auth**: For authentication and authorization
- **@tekup/config**: For configuration management

### Data Flow Between Systems

The CRM system would establish bidirectional data flows with existing Tekup applications, maintaining tenant isolation:

1. **From flow-api to CRM**: Lead data synchronization, tenant information, user permissions
2. **From CRM to flow-api**: Lead status updates, conversion notifications, activity logs
3. **From tekup-lead-platform to CRM**: Qualified lead data, scoring information, nurturing history
4. **From CRM to tekup-lead-platform**: Conversion feedback, sales outcomes, deal values
5. **Between CRM and inbox-ai**: Contact synchronization, deal context, communication history
6. **Between CRM and tekup-mobile**: Real-time data synchronization for offline access

All data flows would maintain strict tenant isolation, ensuring that Rendetalje data never mixes with Foodtruck Fiesta or Tekup data.

## Business Logic

### Lead Conversion Process

1. When a lead is qualified in the existing lead system, it can be converted to a CRM entity
2. The conversion process creates:
   - A contact record with lead information
   - A company record if company information is available
   - An initial deal if the lead has sales potential
3. The original lead is marked as converted and linked to the new CRM entities
4. The conversion is synchronized with the lead platform to update lead status and provide feedback on conversion success

### Cross-Application Data Synchronization

The CRM system would maintain data consistency across the Tekup ecosystem through:

1. **Real-time Updates**: Webhook notifications for immediate data synchronization
2. **Batch Processing**: Scheduled synchronization for non-critical data
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Timestamp-based conflict resolution for concurrent updates
4. **Data Validation**: Consistent validation rules across all applications
5. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all data changes across systems

All synchronization processes maintain strict tenant isolation, ensuring data from Rendetalje, Foodtruck Fiesta, and Tekup remains completely separate.

### Deal Pipeline Management

1. Tenants can define custom deal stages
2. Deals progress through stages with validation
3. Win/loss reasons are tracked for closed deals
4. Forecasting capabilities based on deal stages and values

### Activity Tracking

1. Activities can be scheduled for future dates
2. Different activity types (calls, meetings, emails, tasks)
3. Activity outcomes recorded when completed
4. Integration with calendar systems

    G --> G2[Activity List]
    G --> G3[Activity Form]
```

### Integration with flow-web

The CRM frontend would be integrated into the existing `flow-web` application:
1. **Shared Navigation**: CRM modules would appear in the main navigation alongside existing features
2. **Consistent UI**: CRM components would use the same design system and UI components as the rest of the application
3. **Shared Authentication**: The same authentication flow and session management would be used
4. **Unified Data Loading**: API calls would follow the same patterns as existing data fetching in the application

### Design System Alignment

The CRM interface would follow the existing Tekup design language:
1. **Color Palette**: Use the existing brand colors (rendetalje: #059669, foodtruck: #dc2626, tekup: #7c3aed) with neutral grays
2. **Typography**: Use the Inter font family as defined in the Tailwind config
3. **Component Patterns**: Follow the same card-based layouts, table designs, and form patterns as seen in the leads interface
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive grid layouts
5. **Interactive Elements**: Consistent hover states, focus states, and transitions

### State Management

The CRM frontend would use the same state management patterns as the existing `flow-web` application:
- Zustand for global state management
- React Query for server state management
- Context API for tenant-specific context

### UI Components

The CRM would leverage existing UI components from the `@tekup/ui` package and extend them as needed:
- Data tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination
- Forms with validation
- Dashboard components for metrics and charts
- Calendar components for activity scheduling

## Security & Compliance

### Authentication

The CRM system would integrate with the existing authentication system:
- API key-based authentication for server-to-server communication
- JWT-based authentication for user sessions
- OAuth2 integration for third-party services

### Authorization

Role-based access control with the following roles:
- Administrator: Full access to all CRM features
- Sales Manager: Access to all deals and team activities
- Sales Representative: Access to own deals and contacts
- Viewer: Read-only access to CRM data

Each tenant (Rendetalje, Foodtruck Fiesta, Tekup) would have their own separate user management and role assignments.

### Data Protection

- Row-level security (RLS) for tenant data isolation
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest
- Audit logging for all data modifications
- GDPR compliance for data subject rights

The multi-tenant architecture ensures that Rendetalje data is completely isolated from Foodtruck Fiesta and Tekup data, with no cross-tenant data access possible.
