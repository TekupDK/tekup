# Distributed AI Consciousness - Agent Mesh Network

> **Revolutionary AI system that is smarter than the sum of its parts through specialization and collective intelligence**

## 🧠 Concept Overview

The Distributed AI Consciousness system implements a revolutionary approach to artificial intelligence where multiple specialized AI agents form a collective intelligence that exceeds the capabilities of any individual agent. This system embodies the principle that **"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts"** through strategic specialization and intelligent collaboration.

### Core Philosophy

- **Specialization**: Each agent excels in a specific cognitive domain
- **Collaboration**: Agents communicate and coordinate to solve complex problems
- **Emergence**: Collective intelligence emerges from agent interactions
- **Adaptation**: The system learns and evolves through experience

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Agent Mesh Network

The system consists of a fully connected mesh network of specialized agents, each with unique capabilities:

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install the package
npm install @tekup/ai-consciousness

# Or using pnpm
pnpm add @tekup/ai-consciousness
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { 
  CollectiveIntelligence, 
  ReasoningAgent, 
  MemoryAgent, 
  PlanningAgent 
} from '@tekup/ai-consciousness';

// Create the collective intelligence system
const collective = new CollectiveIntelligence();

// Start the system
await collective.start();

// Create a complex problem
const problem = {
  id: 'optimization-001',
  type: 'system-optimization',
  description: 'Optimize a distributed system for maximum performance',
  complexity: 8,
  requirements: ['performance', 'reliability', 'scalability'],
  constraints: ['budget', 'timeline'],
  context: { currentSystem: 'legacy' },
  priority: 'high'
};

// Solve using collective intelligence
const solution = await collective.solve(problem);

console.log(`Solution Quality: ${solution.quality}/10`);
console.log(`Confidence: ${(solution.confidence * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
```

### Advanced Usage

```typescript
// Create custom agents
const customReasoningAgent = new ReasoningAgent('custom-reasoning-001');
const customMemoryAgent = new MemoryAgent('custom-memory-001');

// Add to collective intelligence
await collective.addAgent(customReasoningAgent);
await collective.addAgent(customMemoryAgent);

// Create specialized problems
const planningProblem = {
  id: 'planning-001',
  type: 'project-planning',
  description: 'Plan a complex software migration project',
  complexity: 9,
  requirements: ['planning', 'coordination', 'execution'],
  constraints: ['budget', 'timeline', 'resources'],
  context: { projectType: 'migration' },
  priority: 'critical'
};

// Solve with specialized agents
const planningSolution = await collective.solve(planningProblem);
```

## 🔧 Problem Distribution Strategies

The system automatically selects the optimal strategy based on problem complexity:

### 1. **Sequential Strategy** (Complexity ≤ 3)
- Agents work one after another
- Each agent builds on previous insights
- Best for simple, linear problems

### 2. **Parallel Strategy** (Complexity 4-6)
- Agents work simultaneously
- Results combined at the end
- Best for independent sub-problems

### 3. **Collaborative Strategy** (Complexity 7-10)
- Agents coordinate and share insights
- Real-time communication and adaptation
- Best for complex, interdependent problems

## 📊 Performance Metrics

The system tracks comprehensive performance metrics:

```typescript
const systemState = collective.getSystemState();

console.log(`Problems Solved: ${systemState.performanceMetrics.problemsSolved}`);
console.log(`Average Quality: ${systemState.performanceMetrics.averageQuality.toFixed(2)}/10`);
console.log(`Agent Utilization:`, systemState.performanceMetrics.agentUtilization);
console.log(`Specialty Effectiveness:`, systemState.performanceMetrics.specialtyEffectiveness);
```

## 🧪 Demonstration

Run the built-in demonstration to see the system in action:

```typescript
import { demo } from '@tekup/ai-consciousness';

// Run the demonstration
await demo();
```

This will:
1. Initialize the collective intelligence system
2. Create a complex optimization problem
3. Solve it using all three specialized agents
4. Display the collective solution and insights
5. Show system performance metrics

## 🔬 Extending the System

### Creating Custom Agents

```typescript
import { BaseAgentNode } from '@tekup/ai-consciousness';

class CustomAgent extends BaseAgentNode {
  constructor(id: string) {
    const capabilities = [{
      specialty: 'custom' as any,
      strength: 8,
      confidence: 0.8,
      experience: 3,
      adaptability: 7
    }];
    
    super(id, 'custom', capabilities);
  }

  protected async _solveProblem(problem: Problem): Promise<Solution> {
    // Implement custom problem-solving logic
    return {
      id: `custom_solution_${Date.now()}`,
      problemId: problem.id,
      agentId: this.id,
      approach: 'Custom approach',
      reasoning: ['Custom reasoning'],
      implementation: 'Custom implementation',
      confidence: 0.8,
      quality: 7,
      tradeoffs: ['Custom tradeoffs'],
      alternatives: ['Custom alternatives'],
      timestamp: new Date()
    };
  }

  protected async _processMessage(message: AgentMessage): Promise<void> {
    // Handle custom message types
  }

  protected async _integrateLearning(experience: Experience): Promise<void> {
    // Implement custom learning logic
  }
}
```

### Adding New Specialties
