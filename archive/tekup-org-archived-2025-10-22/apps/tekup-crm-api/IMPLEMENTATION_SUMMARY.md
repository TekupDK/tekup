## Multi-Tenant Architecture

The CRM system supports the three existing tenants with complete data isolation:
- **Rendetalje** (green brand color: #059669)
- **Foodtruck Fiesta** (red brand color: #dc2626)
- **Tekup** (purple brand color: #7c3aed)

Each tenant has:
- Isolated data storage using Row-Level Security
- Custom branding and colors
- Independent configuration
- Tenant-specific workflows

## Security Features

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for user sessions, API keys for service-to-service communication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (Admin, Sales Manager, Sales Rep, Viewer)
- **Data Protection**: Row-level security for tenant data isolation
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all data modifications
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and secure key management

## Technology Stack Consistency

The CRM system follows the same technology stack as other Tekup applications:
- **Backend**: NestJS, TypeScript, Prisma ORM
- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Shared Packages**: @tekup/auth, @tekup/config, @tekup/ui, @tekup/api-client
- **Infrastructure**: PNPM workspaces, Docker containerization, Kubernetes deployment

## Environment and Configuration

The CRM system is pre-configured with:
- Environment files for all environments (.env.example)
- Integration with @tekup/config for centralized configuration management
- Secure storage for API keys and credentials
- Multi-tenancy configuration for the three known tenants
- Monitoring and logging setup

## API Endpoints

### Core Entities
- **Contacts**: CRUD operations, activity tracking
- **Companies**: CRUD operations, relationship management
- **Deals**: CRUD operations, pipeline management, stage progression
- **Activities**: CRUD operations, calendar integration, reminder system
- **Deal Stages**: Custom stage management
- **Activity Types**: Custom activity type management

### Integration Endpoints
- **Lead Conversion**: Convert leads to CRM entities
- **Inbox Integration**: Email context and activity linking
- **Mobile APIs**: Optimized endpoints for mobile applications
- **Reporting**: Sales performance, conversion rates, activity metrics
- **API Keys**: Key generation, validation, and revocation

## Deployment Architecture

The CRM system follows the same deployment patterns as existing Tekup services:
- **Containerization**: Docker images for API service
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose for local development, Kubernetes for production
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipelines consistent with existing services
- **Monitoring**: Integration with existing metrics and logging systems
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling of API instances based on load

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive tests for all business logic
- **Integration Testing**: API endpoint testing with database interactions
- **End-to-End Testing**: Critical user workflow validation
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for high-volume scenarios

## Future Enhancements

The foundation is now in place for additional features:
- Advanced reporting and dashboard customization
- Workflow automation and business process management
- AI-powered lead scoring and recommendations
- Enhanced third-party integrations
- Advanced analytics and forecasting

The CRM system is ready for production use and fully integrated with the Tekup ecosystem.
