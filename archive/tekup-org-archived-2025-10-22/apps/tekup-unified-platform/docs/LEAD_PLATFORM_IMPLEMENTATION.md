## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Controller Layer (`leads.controller.ts`)
- **Comprehensive API**: All 16 endpoints fully implemented
- **Validation**: Input validation and error handling
- **Multi-tenancy**: Automatic tenant scoping via decorators
- **AI Integration**: Fallback mechanisms for AI features

### Service Layer (`leads.service.ts`)

- **Analytics**: Real-time analytics calculations
- **Conversion Flow**: Automated customer creation from qualified leads

### Database Schema (`schema.prisma`)
```prisma
model Lead {
  id             String   @id @default(cuid())
  name           String
  email          String?
  phone          String?
  company        String?
  source         String?
  status         String   @default("new")
  score          Int?
  qualifiedAt    DateTime?
  convertedAt    DateTime?
  conversionType String?
  notes          String?
  customData     String   @default("{}")
  tenantId       String
  // ... relationships and timestamps
}

model LeadQualification {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  criteria  String
  result    String
  score     Int?
  notes     String?
  leadId    String
  // ... relationships and timestamps
}
```

## üìä Lead Scoring Algorithm

The implemented scoring system evaluates leads based on:

- **Email Contact** (+20 points): Has verified email address
- **Phone Contact** (+30 points): Has phone number for direct communication  
- **Company Information** (+20 points): Associated with a company
- **Referral Source** (+20 points): Came through referral channel
- **Website Source** (+10 points): Organic website lead
- **Maximum Score**: 100 points

### Customizable Factors
The scoring can be extended with:
- Industry-specific scoring
- Geographic preferences  
- Lead interaction history
- External data enrichment

## üîÑ Lead Lifecycle Management

### Status Progression
1. **new** ‚Üí Initial lead capture
2. **contacted** ‚Üí First contact attempted/made
3. **qualified** ‚Üí Meets qualification criteria
4. **unqualified** ‚Üí Doesn't meet criteria
5. **converted** ‚Üí Successfully converted to customer

### Qualification Process
- Multiple qualification criteria can be added
- Each criterion has individual scoring
- Results tracked with detailed notes
- Automated status updates

### Conversion Flow
- Creates Customer record automatically
- Links activities and follow-ups
- Maintains audit trail
- Updates analytics in real-time
