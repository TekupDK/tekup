## First Issue Draft: "How I Built 5 Businesses with AI Assistance"

### Subject Line Options:
- "How I manage 5 businesses with AI (and you can too)"
- "The AI development stack that runs my multi-business empire"
- "From zero to â‚¬500K ARR: My AI-first journey"

### Content:

**This Week's AI Win**
Implemented voice ordering for our food truck using Cursor and custom Danish NLP. Reduced order processing from 3 minutes to 30 seconds. Revenue up 23% in first month due to faster customer throughput.

**Deep Dive: Multi-Business Architecture with AI**
Here's how I structure code to manage multiple businesses from one codebase:

```typescript
// Business context switching
const BusinessContext = {
  foodtruck: { voice: 'danish-casual', workflows: ['ordering', 'inventory'] },
  essenza: { voice: 'danish-formal', workflows: ['booking', 'customer-service'] },
  rendetalje: { voice: 'danish-technical', workflows: ['calculations', 'reporting'] }
}
```

The key is treating each business as a configuration layer rather than separate codebases...

**Multi-Business Spotlight: Unified Customer Data**
Challenge: Customer appears in multiple businesses but data was siloed.
Solution: Built CrossSync tool that automatically matches customers across systems using AI-powered name/contact matching.
Result: 95% accuracy, saves 5 hours/week of manual data entry.

**Tool of the Week: Cursor Composer**
Game-changer for multi-file edits. I can say "update the voice commands across all business modules" and it understands the context across 15+ files. Saves 2-3 hours per feature implementation.

**Quick Wins:**
1. Use AI to generate test data for all your business scenarios
2. Create voice command aliases for your most common operations  
3. Set up automated code documentation with AI summaries
4. Use AI to generate realistic customer personas for each business
5. Implement AI-powered error handling that provides business-context solutions
