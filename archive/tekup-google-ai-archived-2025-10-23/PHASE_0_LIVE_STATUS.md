## 💡 Strategic Alignment

### ✅ Current Strategy: ALIGNED

**Old Mindset (Wrong):**
- "Build perfect infrastructure"
- "Prepare for scale"
- "Follow best practices"

**New Mindset (Right):**
- "Solve real problems"
- "Validate with users"
- "Ship features first"

### Core Principles
```
1. Ship features >> Perfect infrastructure
2. Real users >> Theoretical scale
3. Simple >> Complex
4. Revenue >> Technology
5. Document >> Optimize
```

### Phase 0 Focus
```
✅ Customer 360 view (solve problem: see customer history)
✅ Email validation (solve problem: save time on emails)
✅ Documentation (solve problem: how does it work?)

❌ Infrastructure optimization (no problem to solve)
❌ Advanced features (no validation yet)
❌ Scaling preparation (no users yet)
```

## 🎯 Coordination Status

### Multi-Chat Alignment: 100% ✅

**Communication:**
- ✅ All chats have access to RENOS_PRAGMATIC_ROADMAP.md
- ✅ All chats have access to COORDINATION_MESSAGE_FOR_OTHER_CHATS.md
- ✅ All chats understand Phase 0 priorities
- ✅ All chats following decision framework

**Decision Framework (Applied by All Chats):**
```
Q1: Does Rendetalje need this to USE the system?
    NO → Don't build it
    YES → Continue

Q2: Will it save them >1 hour/week?
    NO → Deprioritize
    YES → Continue

Q3: Can I build it in <1 week?
    NO → Break it down
    YES → Ship it
```

**Coordination Channels:**
- Strategy documents in workspace root
- This live status dashboard (PHASE_0_LIVE_STATUS.md)
- Regular checkpoint updates
