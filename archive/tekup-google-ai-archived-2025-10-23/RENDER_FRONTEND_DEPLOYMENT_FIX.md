# Render Frontend Deployment Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API Configuration (✅ Fixed)
**Problem**: Frontend components were using `localhost:3000` for API calls in production.

**Solution**: Updated the following components to use proper environment variable fallback:
- `EmailQualityMonitor.tsx`
- `RateLimitMonitor.tsx`
- `FollowUpTracker.tsx`

Changed from:
```typescript
const API_BASE = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE || 'http://localhost:3000';
```

To:
```typescript
const API_BASE = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'https://tekup-renos.onrender.com';
```

### 2. Missing manifest.json (✅ Fixed)
**Problem**: PWA manifest file was missing, causing 404 errors.

**Solution**: Created `/client/public/manifest.json` with proper PWA configuration.

### 3. Missing Icons (✅ Fixed)
**Problem**: Icon files referenced in index.html didn't exist.

**Solution**: Updated references to use existing `vite.svg` file temporarily.

## Render Environment Variables

To complete the fix, you need to set the following environment variable in Render:

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select the `tekup-renos-frontend` service
3. Go to Environment → Environment Variables
4. Add:
   - **Key**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://tekup-renos.onrender.com` (or your backend URL)

## Deploy Steps

1. Commit and push these changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: update frontend API configuration for production deployment"
   git push origin cursor/fix-frontend-deployment-errors-047e
   ```

2. Render will automatically deploy the changes

3. Verify the deployment:
   - Check that API calls no longer fail with localhost errors
   - Verify manifest.json loads correctly
   - Confirm no more 404 errors in console

## Build Optimization (Optional)

The build shows warnings about large chunks (>500KB). This can be addressed later by:
- Implementing code splitting with dynamic imports
- Adding more manual chunks in vite config
- Lazy loading heavy components

## Notes

- All other components already use the correct API configuration pattern
- The service worker is properly configured for offline support
- PWA features are enabled but icons should be replaced with proper designs
