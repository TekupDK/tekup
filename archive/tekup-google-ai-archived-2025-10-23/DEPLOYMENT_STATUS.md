## 🔍 How to Monitor

2. Select service: **tekup-renos**
3. Check **"Logs"** tab for real-time progress

**What to Look For:**
```
[Build] Installing dependencies...
[Build] Running build script...
[Build] Build succeeded ✅
[Deploy] Starting new version...
[Deploy] Health check passed ✅
[Deploy] Live
```

### Method 2: Wait & Test Health Endpoint
```powershell
# Wait 15-20 minutes after git push, then:
curl.exe https://tekup-renos.onrender.com/api/health

# Expected (when ready):
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "runMode": "dry-run",
  "database": "connected",
  "llm": "gemini"
}
```

### Method 3: Check in 5 Minutes
```powershell
# Quick check if deployment started
curl.exe -I https://tekup-renos.onrender.com/api/health

# 502 = Still building
# 200 = Deployment complete!
```
