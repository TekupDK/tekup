## 🎯 Phase 0 Alignment

**Goal:** Make Rendetalje.dk use system voluntarily for 2 weeks and save 1+ hour/week

**How This Helps:**
1. **Single Source of Truth** - All customer data in one view (no more searching multiple systems)
2. **Faster Customer Support** - See full history instantly (emails, leads, bookings)
3. **Better Follow-up** - Identify customers with open leads or pending bookings
4. **Time Savings:**
   - Before: Check email, CRM, calendar separately (5-10 min per customer)
   - After: One view with all data (30 seconds per customer)
   - **Estimated Savings:** 15-30 minutes/day = 5-10 hours/month
