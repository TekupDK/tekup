## ‚ö†Ô∏è PRE-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

### 1. Environment Configuration

#### RUN_MODE Setting
- [ ] Verify `RUN_MODE` setting in deployment environment
- [ ] For testing: `RUN_MODE=dry-run` (emails logged, not sent)
- [ ] For production: `RUN_MODE=live` (emails actually sent)
- [ ] **WARNING:** Double-check Render.com environment variables

#### Email Automation Flags
- [ ] `AUTO_RESPONSE_ENABLED=false` (default OFF for safety)
- [ ] `FOLLOW_UP_ENABLED=false` (default OFF for safety)
- [ ] `ESCALATION_ENABLED=true` (can be ON - it's safe)

**RULE:** Never enable AUTO_RESPONSE or FOLLOW_UP without:
1. Thorough testing in dry-run mode
2. Manual review of generated emails
3. Approval from Jonas
4. 24-hour monitoring after activation

## üìß EMAIL QUALITY VALIDATION

### Template Quality Checks
Run these checks before enabling auto-response:

#### 1. Business Hours Enforcement
```bash
# Check calendar slot suggestions
npm run booking:next-slot 120
```
**Expected:** All suggested times between 08:00-17:00 (no midnight/after-hours)

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] 56m¬≤ flyttereng√∏ring ‚Üí Times should be 08:00-17:00
- [ ] Request on Friday afternoon ‚Üí Should suggest Monday morning
- [ ] Request at 23:00 ‚Üí Should suggest next day 08:00

#### 2. Placeholder Prevention
**Manually test email generation with missing data:**

```bash
# Create test lead with missing squareMeters
# Expected: Email should ASK for info, not show [Ukendt]
```

**Check for:**
- [ ] No `[Ukendt]` in email body
- [ ] No `[X]`, `[Y]`, `[navn]` placeholders
- [ ] Professional fallback messages for missing data

#### 3. Competitive Pricing
**Test pricing for common scenarios:**

```bash
# Test 56m¬≤ apartment
node -e "import('./src/services/pricingService').then(m => console.log(m.estimateCleaningJob(56, 'flyttereng√∏ring')))"
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] 56m¬≤ flyttereng√∏ring: `1.396-2.094kr` (shows RANGE, not just max)
- [ ] 80m¬≤ almindelig: Reasonable estimate
- [ ] 120m¬≤ dybdereng√∏ring: Shows both min and max

**Email should emphasize:**
- [ ] Minimum price first (competitive positioning)
- [ ] Range format: "ca. 1.400-2.100kr"
- [ ] "Du betaler kun faktisk tidsforbrug" text included

## üîí SECURITY VERIFICATION

### Auto-Send Locations Audit
Verify ALL 4 auto-send locations are safe:

#### 1. leadMonitor.ts (Line 173-206)
- [ ] Auto-response code is commented out
- [ ] Contains detailed safety comments
- [ ] Checks `isAutoResponseEnabled()` if uncommented
- [ ] Status: **DISABLED ‚úÖ**

#### 2. followUpService.ts (Line 269)
- [ ] `sendGenericEmail` call disabled
- [ ] Early return statement present
- [ ] Warning log about skipped emails
- [ ] Imports `isFollowUpEnabled` (for future use)
- [ ] Status: **DISABLED ‚úÖ**

#### 3. escalationService.ts (Line 175-187)
- [ ] Checks `isEscalationEnabled()` before sending
- [ ] Checks `isLiveMode` before sending
- [ ] Only triggers on conflict detection (safety feature)
- [ ] Status: **SAFE (can be enabled) ‚úÖ**

#### 4. dashboardRoutes.ts (API Endpoints)
- [ ] Line 731: POST /threads/:id/reply
- [ ] Line 1189: Email approval endpoint
- [ ] **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** These require authentication
- [ ] Status: **REQUIRES AUTH (pending) ‚ö†Ô∏è**

### Rate Limiting Test
```bash
# Test email gateway rate limiting
# Should block after 10 emails in 5 minutes
```

- [ ] Rate limit enforced for each source
- [ ] Blocked requests logged properly
- [ ] Counter resets after 5 minute window

---

## üß™ PRE-PRODUCTION TESTING

### Dry-Run Mode Testing
**Environment:** `RUN_MODE=dry-run`

1. **Test Auto-Response (if enabling):**
   ```bash
   # Temporarily set AUTO_RESPONSE_ENABLED=true in .env
   npm run leads:check
   ```
   - [ ] Email logged but NOT sent
   - [ ] Gmail API NOT called
   - [ ] Logs show "[DRY-RUN]" prefix

2. **Test Follow-Up (if enabling):**
   ```bash
   npm run email:monitor
   ```
   - [ ] Follow-ups logged but NOT sent
   - [ ] Status remains "pending" in database
   - [ ] No Gmail API calls

3. **Test Escalation:**
   ```bash
   # Create test email with conflict keywords
   ```
   - [ ] Conflict detected correctly
   - [ ] Escalation logged
   - [ ] Email would send in live mode (dry-run shows intent)

### Email Quality Manual Review
Before going live, manually review 5-10 generated emails:

- [ ] Professional tone maintained
- [ ] No grammatical errors
- [ ] Correct pricing calculations
- [ ] Business hours times only
- [ ] No placeholders or [Ukendt] text
- [ ] Proper Danish spelling
