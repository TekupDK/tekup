## üéØ What Is Render MCP?

The **Render Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** allows developers to manage Render.com infrastructure using natural language prompts directly from AI-powered IDEs like GitHub Copilot and Cursor.

### Key Capabilities

‚úÖ **Service Management**
- Create new web services and static sites
- List all services in workspace
- View service status and details
- Update environment variables

‚úÖ **Database Operations**
- Create Postgres databases and Redis instances
- Run read-only SQL queries
- Monitor connection counts and storage

‚úÖ **Monitoring & Troubleshooting**
- Pull filtered logs (error, warning, info levels)
- Analyze metrics (CPU, memory, response times)
- View deploy history and status
- Debug production issues

‚úÖ **Performance Analysis**
- Track response counts by status code
- Monitor autoscaling behavior
- Analyze traffic patterns
- Identify performance bottlenecks

‚ùå **Safety Limitations**
- Cannot delete services or databases
- Cannot modify scaling settings
- Cannot trigger deploys manually
- SQL queries are read-only

## üöÄ How to Get Started

### For Team Members

1. **Create API Key** (2 minutes)
   - Visit: <https://dashboard.render.com/account/api-keys>
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Name it: `MCP Integration - [Your Name]`
   - **Save it securely** - you won't see it again!

2. **Configure IDE** (3 minutes)
   - Follow instructions in [RENDER_MCP_QUICK_SETUP.md](./docs/RENDER_MCP_QUICK_SETUP.md)
   - Add MCP server URL and API key to configuration
   - Restart IDE

3. **Test It** (30 seconds)
   ```
   "Set my Render workspace to rendetalje"
   "List my Render services"
   ```

### Example Commands for RenOS

```bash
# Service Status
"Show status of tekup-renos and tekup-renos-frontend"
"When was the last deploy?"
"Are there any health check failures?"

# Database Queries
"Query the database for customers created this week"
"Show me connection count for rendetalje-db"
"What's the current database storage usage?"

# Troubleshooting
"Pull error logs from the last hour"
"Why is response time slower today?"
"Show me any 5xx errors"

# Configuration
"List environment variables for tekup-renos"
"What's the current RUN_MODE setting?"
"Show me database connection string"
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### API Key Management

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit to Git** - API keys are broadly scoped
- ‚úÖ **Use password manager** - Store securely (1Password, LastPass, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Rotate every 90 days** - Create new keys regularly
- ‚úÖ **Audit usage** - Review in Render dashboard

### MCP Permissions

The MCP server can:
- ‚úÖ Read all service and database information
- ‚úÖ Create new services and databases
- ‚úÖ Update environment variables
- ‚ùå Delete services or databases (safety feature)
- ‚ùå Modify scaling or deployment settings

### Best Practices

1. **Review before confirming** - Always check suggested changes
2. **Use read-only queries** - Database queries are read-only by default
3. **Monitor audit logs** - Track MCP activity in Render dashboard
4. **Limit key scope** - Create separate keys for different team members
5. **Revoke immediately** - If key is compromised, revoke in dashboard

## üéØ Use Cases for RenOS

### 1. Deployment Verification

**Scenario**: After pushing code to production

```
"Verify the latest deploy succeeded"
"Check error rates for the past 10 minutes"
"Are there any health check failures?"
```

### 2. Database Analysis

**Scenario**: Understanding customer data

```
"Query database for top 5 customers by lead count"
"Show me customers created in October 2025"
"What's the average leads per customer?"
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring

**Scenario**: Daily health check

```
"What was peak traffic time yesterday?"
"Did we autoscale during that period?"
"Show me average response time for last 24 hours"
```

### 4. Incident Response

**Scenario**: Production issue reported

```
"Pull error logs from the last 30 minutes"
"How many 5xx errors occurred?"
"What's causing the high memory usage?"
```

### 5. Configuration Management

**Scenario**: Verifying environment setup

```
"List all environment variables for tekup-renos"
"Is RUN_MODE set to 'live' or 'dry-run'?"
"Show me the DATABASE_URL configuration"
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
IDE (Copilot/Cursor)
    ‚Üì
Natural Language Prompt
    ‚Üì
MCP Protocol
    ‚Üì
Render MCP Server (https://mcp.render.com/mcp)
    ‚Üì
Render REST API
    ‚Üì
RenOS Infrastructure (tekup-renos, tekup-renos-frontend, rendetalje-db)
```

### Configuration Files

**GitHub Copilot (VS Code)**:
- Location varies by VS Code version
- Add to MCP configuration with server URL and API key

**Cursor**:
- `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- JSON format with mcpServers object

**Claude Desktop**:
- `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Mac)
- `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows)

### Environment Variables

The MCP server uses the Render API key via the `Authorization` header:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "render": {
      "url": "https://mcp.render.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_RENDER_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üìä Impact on RenOS Development

### Benefits

1. **Faster troubleshooting** - Query logs and metrics without leaving IDE
2. **Improved visibility** - Real-time production insights during development
3. **Reduced context switching** - No need to open Render dashboard
4. **Data-driven decisions** - Query database for customer insights
5. **Safer deployments** - Verify status immediately after push

### Workflow Integration

**Before Development:**
```
