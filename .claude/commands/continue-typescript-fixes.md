# Continue TypeScript Fixes

Resume TypeScript error fixing from documented status.

## Knowledge-First Approach

1. **Load current status**
   - Read TYPESCRIPT_FIX_STATUS.md for context
   - Load REMAINING_TYPESCRIPT_ERRORS.json for categorized errors
   - Check what was already attempted

2. **Pick next priority from JSON**
   - Follow priority order in REMAINING_TYPESCRIPT_ERRORS.json
   - Start with "nextSteps" array

3. **Execute fixes**
   - Use Python/bash scripts (proven to work)
   - Follow patterns from previous commits (937cc19, 4e4f7b2, fd770b4)
   - Commit after each category fixed

4. **Update documentation**
   - Update TYPESCRIPT_FIX_STATUS.md with progress
   - Update REMAINING_TYPESCRIPT_ERRORS.json with new counts
   - Note any new issues discovered

## Auto-Resume

This command is designed for AI to pick up exactly where previous session left off.
All context is in the JSON files - no need to ask user for history.

## Target

Continue until 0 TypeScript errors or all high-priority errors resolved.
