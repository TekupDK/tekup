## Migration Guide

### From 0.x to 1.0.0

#### Test Database Setup
```powershell
# Start test database
.\scripts\start-test-db.ps1

# Verify connection
# PostgreSQL: postgresql://renos_test:renos_test_password@localhost:5433/renos_test
# Redis: redis://:renos_test_redis_password@localhost:6380
```

#### Environment Variables
Add to your `.env.test`:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://renos_test:renos_test_password@localhost:5433/renos_test
REDIS_URL=redis://:renos_test_redis_password@localhost:6380
JWT_SECRET=test_jwt_secret_key_for_testing_only
NODE_ENV=test
```

#### CI/CD Integration
The GitHub Actions pipeline runs automatically on push/PR. No manual setup required for contributors.

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Backend
cd backend-nestjs
npm run test        # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e    # E2E tests

# Frontend
cd frontend-nextjs
npm run test        # Unit + component tests
npm run test:e2e    # Playwright E2E tests

# Shared
cd shared
npm run test        # All tests with coverage
```

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Playwright E2E tests require actual component implementations (currently reference placeholders)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some backend unit tests need adjustment for real service implementations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Mobile app testing infrastructure not yet implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-time Socket.io features not covered by tests

### Workarounds
- E2E tests will need updates once UI components are implemented
- Backend unit tests use mocks for external dependencies (adjust as needed)
- Mobile testing can use web E2E tests as baseline until native infrastructure is ready
