## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues:
1. **Assets Missing**: App icon, splash screen, and other assets need to be created (instructions provided)
2. **EAS Project ID**: Needs to be set in `app.json` after running `eas init`
3. **Google Maps API**: Optional, but recommended for accurate geocoding

### Limitations:
1. **Geocoding**: Falls back to mock data if Google Maps API key not configured
2. **Map Markers**: Use mock coordinates in development without geocoding
3. **Testing**: No automated tests implemented (infrastructure ready)

**None of these prevent the app from working. They're configuration items.**
