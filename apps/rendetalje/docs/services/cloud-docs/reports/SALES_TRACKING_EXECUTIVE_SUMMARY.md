# Internal Sales Tracking System - Executive Summary

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Internal Sales Tracking System  
**Purpose**: Centralize and automate sales management across Tekup's three business units  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Timeline**: 16 weeks (4 phases)  
**Investment Level**: Internal development project

---

## Business Context

### The Problem

Tekup operates three distinct business units with different service offerings:
- **Rendetalje**: Cleaning services (residential & commercial)
- **Tekup**: IT consulting and software development
- **Foodtruck Fiesta**: Event catering and food services

**Current Pain Points:**
1. Sales tracked manually in disconnected spreadsheets and email
2. No unified view of business performance across units
3. Leads fall through cracks due to poor follow-up tracking
4. Manual invoice creation in Billy.dk is time-consuming
5. Customer relationship history scattered across multiple systems
6. Reporting requires manual data gathering from various sources
7. No visibility into sales pipeline or conversion metrics

### The Solution

A unified web-based internal tool that:
- ✅ Centralizes all sales data in one system
- ✅ Automates invoice generation via Billy.dk integration
- ✅ Tracks leads from inquiry to sale conversion
- ✅ Provides real-time sales pipeline visibility
- ✅ Maintains complete customer relationship history
- ✅ Enables data-driven decision making with analytics
- ✅ Reduces administrative time by 50%+

## Strategic Benefits

### Operational Efficiency

| Metric | Current State | Target State | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Time to log a sale | 10-15 minutes (manual) | < 2 minutes | 80% reduction |
| Invoice creation time | 5-10 minutes/invoice | Automatic | 100% automation |
| Missed follow-ups | ~30% of leads | < 5% | 90% reduction |
