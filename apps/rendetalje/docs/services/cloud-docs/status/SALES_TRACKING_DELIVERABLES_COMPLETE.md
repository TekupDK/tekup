### Subtasks (Development Phase): ‚è≥ PENDING FOR DEVELOPERS
The 91 subtasks showing as "PENDING" represent the actual development work to be executed by the development team over 16 weeks. These are NOT incomplete documentation tasks - they are the implementation checklist items that I was asked to create.

**This is intentional and correct** - the checklist items should remain PENDING until developers complete them during the 16-week implementation phase.

## üöÄ Ready for Next Phase

The planning and documentation phase is **COMPLETE**.

**Next Steps for Development Team**:
1. Review all documentation files
2. Set up development environment using Quick Start Guide
