# PC Performance Analysis Report
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Issue:** High CPU usage causing fans to run continuously

---

## üîç **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

Your PC is running **43 Node.js processes** consuming **2.4 GB RAM** and significant CPU resources.

---

## üìä **RESOURCE BREAKDOWN**

### **Top Consumers:**
1. **Multiple IDEs Running Simultaneously**
   - Kiro: 5+ processes (~2.6 GB RAM, 4500+ CPU seconds)
   - VS Code: Multiple instances (~1.3 GB RAM)
   - Windsurf: Multiple processes (~900 MB RAM)
   - Cursor: Running
   
   **Total IDE Memory: ~4.8 GB**

2. **43 Node.js Processes (2.4 GB RAM)**
   - ~30 MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
   - 5 Vitest test workers
   - 8+ other Node.js processes

3. **language_server_windows_x64**
   - Single process using **956 MB RAM**

---

## üéØ **WHAT ARE MCP SERVERS?**

MCP servers are AI assistant backend services that your IDEs (Windsurf, Kiro, Cursor) use to provide smart features:

- **Supabase MCP** - Database queries and management
- **Filesystem MCP** - File system operations
- **Memory MCP** - Conversation memory for AI
- **Sequential Thinking MCP** - Advanced AI reasoning
- **Puppeteer MCP** - Browser automation
- **TaskManager MCP** - Task management features

**Problem:** You have 6+ copies of some MCP servers running (one per IDE instance)!

---

## üí° **IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS**

### **Option 1: Quick Cleanup (Recommended)**
Run the cleanup script:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\empir\Tekup-Cloud
.\cleanup-node-processes.ps1
```

Choose option 1 to stop MCP servers (they'll restart when needed).

### **Option 2: Close Unused IDEs**
You have 4 code editors open simultaneously:
- Close Windsurf if not using
- Close extra VS Code windows
- Close Cursor if not using
- Keep only Kiro (or your primary IDE)

**Expected Savings:** 2-3 GB RAM, significant CPU reduction

### **Option 3: Manual MCP Cleanup**
Stop duplicate MCP servers manually - they'll auto-restart when your IDE needs them.

---

## üöÄ **LONG-TERM RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **1. Use One IDE at a Time**
Running 4 IDEs simultaneously is causing resource multiplication:
- Each IDE spawns its own MCP servers
- Each IDE runs its own extensions
- Memory and CPU usage multiplies

**Recommendation:** Choose your primary IDE (Kiro or Windsurf) and close others.

### **2. Configure MCP Server Sharing**
If possible, configure your IDEs to share MCP servers instead of each spawning their own.

### **3. Disable Unused IDE Extensions**
Check for:
- Vitest extension (spawning 5 workers)
- Unused language servers
- Duplicate extensions across IDEs

### **4. Monitor Resource Usage**
Create a scheduled task to run this command weekly:
```powershell
Get-Process | Sort-Object WorkingSet -Descending | Select-Object -First 20 | Format-Table Name, Id, @{Name="Memory(MB)";Expression={[math]::Round($_.WorkingSet/1MB,2)}}
```

### **5. Restart Regularly**
Restart your PC at least once per week to clear orphaned processes.

## üîß **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **Current System Load:**
```
Total Node.js processes: 43
Total Node.js memory: 2,393 MB
Total Node.js CPU time: ~32 seconds

IDE processes (Kiro + Code + Windsurf + Cursor): 
- Combined memory: ~4.8 GB
- Combined CPU time: 4500+ seconds
```

### **Process Distribution:**
- MCP Servers: ~30 processes
- Vitest Workers: 5 processes  
- IDE Extensions: 8+ processes

### **Duplicate MCP Servers Found:**
- Supabase MCP: 6 instances (should be 1-2)
- Memory MCP: 4 instances (should be 1)
- Filesystem MCP: 3 instances (should be 1)
- Sequential Thinking MCP: 3 instances (should be 1)
- Puppeteer MCP: 2 instances (should be 1)

## ‚úÖ **QUICK FIX CHECKLIST**

- [ ] Run cleanup script (cleanup-node-processes.ps1)
- [ ] Stop MCP servers (option 1 in script)
- [ ] Close Windsurf if not actively using
- [ ] Close extra VS Code windows
- [ ] Close Cursor if not actively using
- [ ] Keep only your primary IDE (Kiro)
- [ ] Monitor fan noise - should reduce significantly
- [ ] Check resource usage after cleanup

**Expected Result:** 
- ~2 GB RAM freed
- CPU usage reduced by 50-70%
- Fans should quiet down within 2-3 minutes

---

## üìû **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Immediate:** Run the cleanup script
2. **Short-term:** Close unused IDEs
3. **Medium-term:** Configure IDE to use fewer extensions
4. **Long-term:** Establish habit of closing unused applications
