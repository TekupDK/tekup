---

### Feature 2: Code Syntax Highlighting

**Implemented:** ‚úÖ Yes (react-syntax-highlighter)

**Rationale:**
1. Essential for developer tool
2. Battle-tested library
3. 100+ languages supported
4. Copy button adds value
5. Competitive parity with GitHub Copilot

**Library chosen:** react-syntax-highlighter over Prism.js

**Why:** 
- React-friendly
- Better TypeScript support
- Theme customization
- Already maintained

---

### Feature 3: Chat History Persistence

**Implemented:** ‚úÖ Yes (Supabase)

**Rationale:**
1. Users want to reference past conversations
2. Learning from history important
3. Archive feature useful for org
4. Future: Search across chats
5. Competitive feature (ChatGPT has it)

**Decision:** Store all messages, not just summaries

**Trade-off:** More storage cost, but better UX

---

### Feature 4: File Upload

**Implemented:** ‚ùå No (Phase 2)

**Rationale for deferral:**
1. MVP doesn't require it
2. Adds complexity
3. Security concerns (file validation)
4. Can paste code as workaround
5. Better to nail core features first

**Future:** Planned for Phase 2 (Month 2-3)

---

### Feature 5: Export Conversations

**Implemented:** ‚ùå No (Phase 2)

**Rationale for deferral:**
1. Nice-to-have, not critical
2. Can screenshot as workaround
3. Focus on core chat experience
4. Adds engineering time
5. Low user request priority

**Future:** Markdown/PDF export in Phase 2

---

## üîß Technical Decisions

### Database Schema Design

**Tables created:**
1. `chat_sessions` - Conversation containers
2. `messages` - Individual messages
3. `user_preferences` - Future user settings
4. `chat_analytics` - Usage tracking

**Design decisions:**
- UUID primary keys (better for distributed systems)
- JSONB for citations/metadata (flexible schema)
- Timestamps on everything (audit trail)
- Foreign key cascades (data integrity)
- Indexes on common queries (performance)

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ Flexible for future features
- ‚úÖ Good query performance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly more storage vs normalized

---

### API Route Structure

**Chosen structure:**
```
/api/chat      - POST (streaming)
/api/sessions  - GET, POST
/api/messages  - GET
```

**Alternative:** GraphQL

**Why REST:**
1. Simpler for this use case
2. SSE works better with REST
3. Less overhead
4. Team familiarity

**Future:** Could add GraphQL if needed

---

### Error Handling Strategy

**Approach:** Graceful degradation

**Implementation:**
- TekupVault fails ‚Üí Continue without RAG
- OpenAI fails ‚Üí Show error message
- Supabase fails ‚Üí In-memory fallback (session only)

**Rationale:**
- Better UX than hard failures
- System remains partially functional
- User sees clear error messages

---

## üìä Testing Decisions

### Test Strategy

**Chosen:** Manual testing with documented scenarios

**Not chosen:** 
- ‚ùå Full unit test suite (yet)
- ‚ùå E2E automation (yet)
- ‚ùå Integration tests (yet)

**Rationale:**
1. MVP priority: Ship fast
2. 20 documented test scenarios sufficient
3. Can add automated tests in Phase 2
4. Manual validation catches UX issues
5. Budget constraints

**Future:** Add Vitest unit tests in Phase 2

---

### Test Scenarios

**Created:** 20 comprehensive scenarios

**Categories:**
1. Knowledge Retrieval (30%)
2. Code Assistance (25%)
3. Strategic Decisions (20%)
4. Multi-Turn (15%)
5. Edge Cases (10%)

**Rationale:** Cover real-world usage patterns, not just happy path

---

## üí∞ Cost Optimization Decisions

### Infrastructure Choices

**Render.com vs Vercel:**
- Chose Render for cost ($7 vs $20/month)
- Both support SSE
- Render better for long-running connections

**Supabase Free vs Pro:**
- Chose Pro ($25/month) for:
  - More database storage
  - Better performance
  - Point-in-time recovery
  - Priority support

**OpenAI Model:**
- Chose GPT-4o over GPT-4 Turbo
  - Faster responses
  - Cheaper per token
  - Better at following instructions

---

### Scaling Decisions

**Current architecture supports:**
- 10-50 concurrent users
- 1000+ queries per day
- 100GB database storage

**If scale needed:**
- Add Redis caching
- Upgrade Supabase tier
- Implement rate limiting
- Consider OpenAI batch API

**Decision:** Don't over-engineer for scale we don't have yet

---

## üîí Security Decisions

### Authentication

**MVP Decision:** No authentication (single user: demo-user)

**Rationale:**
1. Internal tool (trusted network)
2. MVP speed priority
3. Can add later without data migration
4. RLS policies already in place

**Future:** NextAuth.js in Phase 3 (Month 4-6)

---

### API Key Management

**Approach:** Environment variables only

**Decisions:**
- ‚úÖ .env.local (git-ignored)
- ‚úÖ Render environment variables
- ‚úÖ Never commit secrets
- ‚ùå Not using secrets manager yet

**Trade-off:** Good enough for MVP, can upgrade later

---

### Data Privacy

**Decisions:**
1. No customer PII indexed in TekupVault
2. Chat logs contain only internal discussions
3. OpenAI data retention: per their policy (30 days)
4. Supabase: EU region (GDPR compliant)

**Policy:** Don't discuss customer data in chats

---

## üìù Documentation Decisions
