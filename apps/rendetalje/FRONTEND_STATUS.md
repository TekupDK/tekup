## ⚠️ Railway Deployment Issue

### Problem

Frontend was deployed to same service as backend instead of separate service.

### Current State

- ✅ **Backend NestJS:** <https://rendetalje-ai-production.up.railway.app> (working)
- ❌ **Frontend Next.js:** Not deployed separately

### Solution Required

**You need to manually deploy frontend via Railway Dashboard:**

1. Go to: <https://railway.app/dashboard>
2. Login with your account
3. Go to project: **rendetalje-ai**
4. Click **"New"** → **"Service"**
5. Select deployment method:
   - **"GitHub Repo"** (if using Git)
   - **"Empty Service"** (for local deploy)

6. **Configuration:**

   ```
   Name: rendetalje-frontend
   Root Directory: services/frontend-nextjs (if from Git)
   Build Command: npm run build
   Start Command: npm run start
   ```

7. **Environment Variables:**

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://rendetalje-ai-production.up.railway.app
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://dummy.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=dummy-key
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=3002
   ```

8. **Deploy!**

## 🔧 Alternative: Local Testing

While waiting for Railway deployment, you can fully test Friday AI locally:

### Setup

```powershell
# Terminal 1: Frontend (already started)
cd C:\Users\empir\Tekup\apps\rendetalje\services\frontend-nextjs
npm run dev
# Running on: http://localhost:3002

# Terminal 2: Backend (if not on Railway)
cd C:\Users\empir\Tekup\apps\rendetalje\services\backend-nestjs
npm run start:dev
# Running on: http://localhost:3001

# Terminal 3: Inbox Orchestrator (if not on Railway)
cd C:\Users\empir\Tekup\services\tekup-ai\packages\inbox-orchestrator
npm run dev
# Running on: http://localhost:3011
```

### Hybrid Setup (Local Frontend + Railway Backend)

Frontend is already configured to use Railway backend:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` defaults to Railway URL
- Just run frontend locally
- It will call Railway backend automatically

## 📝 Frontend Features to Test

### 1. Login Page

- Navigate to: <http://localhost:3002>
- Should see login form
- Auth provider loaded

### 2. Friday AI Chat Widget

- Look for floating chat button (bottom right corner)
- Click to open chat
- Send test message: "Hej Friday"
- Verify response from backend

### 3. Dashboard (after login)

- Navigate to dashboard
- Chat widget should persist
- Test different messages

## 🎯 Recommended Actions

**Immediate:**

1. ✅ Test frontend locally: <http://localhost:3002>
2. ✅ Verify Friday AI chat widget works
3. ✅ Test integration with Railway backend

**When Ready:**

1. Deploy frontend as separate Railway service (see steps above)
2. Get frontend Railway URL
3. Update backend `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable
4. Test full cloud integration

## ✅ What's Working Now

- ✅ Inbox Orchestrator: Running on Railway
- ✅ Backend NestJS: Running on Railway
- ✅ Frontend Next.js: Running LOCALLY on port 3002
- ✅ Integration: Frontend (local) → Backend (Railway) → Orchestrator (Railway)

You can test the complete Friday AI system right now at: **<http://localhost:3002>**
