## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:

- [ ] Railway CLI installed: `npm i -g @railway/cli`
- [ ] Logged in: `railway login`
- [ ] All code committed and pushed to git
- [ ] Environment variables prepared (see `RAILWAY_ENV_TEMPLATE.md`)
- [ ] Database/Supabase URLs ready
- [ ] API keys ready (Gemini, etc.)

## 🔑 Critical Environment Variables

### Inbox Orchestrator
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key
- `GOOGLE_MCP_URL` - Google MCP service URL

### Backend
- `AI_FRIDAY_URL` - Inbox Orchestrator Railway URL (set after orchestrator deploys)

- `JWT_SECRET` - Generate strong secret
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` - Generate strong secret

### Frontend
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Backend Railway URL (set after backend deploys)

## 🔄 Deployment Order

1. **Inbox Orchestrator** (Friday AI) - Gets its own URL
2. **Backend NestJS** - Needs orchestrator URL, gets its own URL
3. **Frontend Next.js** - Needs backend URL

After each deployment, copy the Railway URL and use it in the next service!

## ✅ Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# 1. Health checks
curl https://<orchestrator-url>/health
curl https://<backend-url>/health

# 2. Test chat
curl -X POST https://<orchestrator-url>/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Test message"}'

# 3. Open frontend
# Visit: https://<frontend-url>
# Login → Test chat widget
```

## 📊 Expected URLs

After deployment, you'll have:

- **Frontend:** `https://rendetalje-frontend-production.up.railway.app`
- **Backend:** `https://rendetalje-backend-production.up.railway.app`
- **Inbox Orchestrator:** `https://inbox-orchestrator-production.up.railway.app`

(Exact URLs will be provided by Railway after deployment)
