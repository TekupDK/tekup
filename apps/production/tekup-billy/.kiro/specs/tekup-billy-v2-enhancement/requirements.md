# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for Tekup-Billy MCP Server v2.0 - a comprehensive enhancement that addresses performance optimization, developer experience improvements, advanced analytics capabilities, and enterprise-grade features. The enhancement builds upon the existing production-ready v1.4.2 system deployed on Render.com to create a next-generation accounting integration platform specifically optimized for Danish businesses using Billy.dk accounting system.

The system currently serves multiple AI platforms (Claude.ai Web, ChatGPT, Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot) and integrates with RenOS backend. Version 2.0 will enhance these integrations while maintaining backward compatibility and leveraging Render.com's infrastructure for improved scalability and reliability.
