# Current Issues - Tekup-Billy MCP

**Date:** 1. November 2025  
**Status:** Overview of all known issues

---

## üî¥ Critical Issues

### 1. Deployment Not Updated
**Problem:** Railway deployment is still running version 1.4.3, but fixes are in commit `1410bac` (version 1.4.4+)

**Impact:**
- Pagination fix NOT deployed (J√∏rgen Pagh still not findable)
- Customer management fixes NOT deployed
- All improvements not available in production

**Root Cause:** Git push blocked by large Electron files in unrelated projects

**Status:** ‚è≥ Awaiting git push resolution

---

### 2. J√∏rgen Pagh Search Issue
**Problem:** ChatGPT cannot find customer "J√∏rgen Pagh" even though he exists in Billy.dk

**Symptoms:**
- Search returns all 61 customers instead of filtering
- J√∏rgen Pagh not in first page results
- `contactPersons` empty in list response

**Root Causes:**
1. ‚ùå **Pagination not implemented** - Only first page (61 customers) fetched
2. ‚ùå **Client-side filtering insufficient** - Cannot search in `contactPersons` email (empty in list)

**Fix Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented in commit `1410bac`
- Pagination loop added to `getContacts()`
- Fetches ALL pages before filtering
- **BUT:** Not deployed yet

**Test Status:** ‚è≥ Cannot test - fixes not deployed

## üü° Medium Priority Issues

### 3. Customer Management Bugs (6 total)
**Problem:** Multiple bugs preventing correct email/phone/address handling

**Status:** ‚úÖ All 6 bugs fixed in commit `1410bac`
1. ‚úÖ Missing contactPersons on CREATE - Fixed
2. ‚úÖ Wrong address field names (cityText/zipcodeText) - Fixed  
3. ‚úÖ Wrong contact type (person vs customer) - Fixed
4. ‚úÖ Unnecessary CREATE+UPDATE workaround - Removed
5. ‚úÖ updateContact overwrites contactPersons - Fixed
6. ‚úÖ Missing name fallback - Fixed

**Impact:** Customer data not saved correctly
**Fix Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented
**Deployment Status:** ‚ùå Not deployed

---

### 4. Git Push Blocked
**Problem:** Cannot push commits to remote due to large Electron files

**Error:**
```
File apps/desktop-electron/release/Rendetalje AI-win32-x64/Rendetalje AI.exe is 168.55 MB
File apps/desktop-electron/release/win-unpacked/Rendetalje AI.exe is 168.55 MB
GH001: Large files detected
```

**Impact:**
- All fixes committed locally but not pushed
- Railway cannot auto-deploy new version
- Production stuck on old version (1.4.3)

**Solutions:**
1. Use Git LFS for large files
2. Exclude large files from repository
3. Push only tekup-billy changes selectively

**Status:** ‚è≥ Blocked - Requires resolution

---

## üü¢ Low Priority / Future Improvements

### 5. Redis Cache Degraded
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Degraded (not critical)
- Redis not configured in Railway
- System falls back to in-memory cache
- Not blocking functionality

**Impact:** Lower cache performance, not shared across instances

---

### 6. Test Coverage
**Status:** ‚è≥ No automated test suite
- Manual testing required
- Test scripts created but not automated
- Integration tests would catch issues earlier

**Recommendation:** Add Jest/Vitest test suite for critical paths

---
