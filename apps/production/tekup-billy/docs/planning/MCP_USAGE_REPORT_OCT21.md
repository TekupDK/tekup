## Key Insights & Findings

### 1. **All Usage is You (PowerShell)**

- **100% of MCP calls today were from YOUR PowerShell scripts**
- No AI integrations (Shortwave, ChatGPT, Claude) used the MCP server today
- Pattern: Manual data analysis and reporting via command-line automation

### 2. **Invoice Analysis Dominance**

- **79% of all tool calls** (107/136) were `get_invoice`
- Single use case: "Analyze all invoices to find product usage patterns"
- Executed at 19:43-45 (2 minutes of intense querying)
- **Result:** Discovered 57/68 products actively used in real invoices

### 3. **Rate Limiting is Working**

- **13 requests blocked** when exceeding 100 req/min limit
- Happened during automated batch processing (expected)
- Did NOT impact overall analysis (88% of invoices processed successfully)
- **Recommendation:** Add 600ms delay between requests in scripts (currently 300ms)

### 4. **Tool Coverage Low**

- **Only 8 out of 32 tools used** (25% coverage)
- Heavily focused on READ operations (list, get)
- No CREATE/UPDATE operations today (no customer/product changes)
- **Interpretation:** MCP used for analysis, not for data entry

### 5. **Performance is Excellent**

- Average 110ms response time (target: <200ms)
- Consistent performance across all tools
- No timeouts or 5xx errors
- **Status:** Production-ready, no optimizations needed

## Comparison: Today vs Oct 11-12 Baseline

| Metric | Oct 11-12 (2 days) | Oct 21 (1 day) | Change |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|--------|
| **Total calls** | ~160 | 136 | -15% |
| **Tools used** | 6 | 8 | +33% |
| **Top tool** | updateProduct (40%) | get_invoice (79%) | Different focus |
| **Success rate** | 100% | 90% | -10% (rate limiting) |
| **Avg response** | <50ms (cached) | 110ms | +120% (uncached) |

**Analysis:**
- **Oct 11-12:** Focus on product catalog maintenance (update/create)
- **Oct 21:** Focus on invoice data analysis (read-heavy)
- **Shift in usage pattern:** From data entry → data analysis

## Shortwave Integration Status

**❌ No Shortwave activity detected today**

### What We Checked

✅ User-Agent strings (none from Shortwave)  
✅ Referrer headers (none from shortwave.com)  
✅ IP addresses (all from your home network)  
✅ Tool patterns (no email→customer automation)

### Expected Shortwave Pattern (Not Seen)

If Shortwave was using MCP, we would see:
- `search_customers` - Search for existing customer by email
- `create_customer` - Create new customer from email signature
- `update_contact` - Add phone/email extracted from message
- User-Agent: Contains "Shortwave" or "shortwave.com"

### Conclusion

**Shortwave MCP integration is configured but not actively used yet.**  
All today's usage came from your manual PowerShell automation scripts.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Performance)

1. **Increase delay in batch scripts**
   - Current: 300ms between requests
   - Recommended: 600ms (100 req/min = 1 req/600ms)
   - Impact: Prevents rate limiting, +30s total execution time

### Short-term (Monitoring)

2. **Enable Supabase Audit Logging**
   - See full tool parameters and results
   - Track error details beyond just 429 status
   - Enable historical analytics and trend analysis

3. **Add Script Logging**
   - Log PowerShell script execution to file
   - Track which analysis you ran and when
   - Correlate with Render logs

### Long-term (Integration)

4. **Test Shortwave Integration**
   - Send test email with customer details
   - Verify MCP tools are called
   - Check `create_customer` + `update_contact` work as expected

5. **Expand Tool Usage**
   - Currently only using 8/32 tools (25%)
   - Consider automating more workflows:
     - Invoice creation from templates
     - Customer onboarding automation
     - Revenue forecasting queries
