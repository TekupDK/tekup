## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed (Red Dot ❌)

**Problem:** Server not responding

**Solutions:**

1. Verify server is running: <https://tekup-billy.onrender.com/health>
2. Check API key is correct (no extra spaces)
3. Ensure Render.com service is awake (free tier sleeps after inactivity)
4. Try refreshing Shortwave

---

### Authentication Error

**Problem:** "Unauthorized" or "Invalid API key"

**Solutions:**

1. Double-check API key: `sp0ZLWofqSDXPx5OjQa64FHVwRYzeuyr`
2. Verify header name is `X-API-Key` (case-sensitive)
3. Re-enter credentials in Shortwave
4. Check for extra spaces when copying API key

---

### Tools Not Appearing

**Problem:** AI doesn't suggest Billy tools

**Solutions:**

1. Verify green dot in integration card
2. Try explicitly asking: "Use Tekup-Billy to list invoices"
3. Check Shortwave has Max/Premier/Business plan
4. Restart Shortwave app

---

### Slow Responses

**Problem:** Tool calls take long time

**Solutions:**

1. First call wakes up Render.com service (30s cold start)
2. Subsequent calls should be fast (1-5s)
3. Upgrade Render.com from free to paid tier
4. Check Billy.dk API status

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

- ✅ Use environment variables in code
- ✅ Rotate keys every 90 days
- ✅ Keep in password manager

### Access Control

- ✅ Only share with authorized team members
- ✅ Use separate keys for different environments
- ✅ Monitor API usage in Render.com logs
- ✅ Revoke compromised keys immediately

---

## 📈 Performance Tips

### Cold Starts

- **First request:** 30-60 seconds (Render.com wake-up)
- **Subsequent requests:** 1-5 seconds
- **Solution:** Upgrade to Render.com paid tier (no sleep)

### Caching

- Shortwave may cache tool results briefly
- Force refresh by being specific: "Show me today's invoices"
- Revenue data updates in real-time from Billy.dk

### Batch Operations

- Ask for multiple things at once:

  ```
  "Show me:
  1. Recent invoices
  2. Total revenue this month
  3. Top 5 customers"
  ```
