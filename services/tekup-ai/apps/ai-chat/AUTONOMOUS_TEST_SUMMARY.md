## 💡 Key Insights

### What Surprised Us

1. **Edge Cases = 100%**
   - Expected some failures
   - Zod validation very robust
   - Next.js handles edge cases well

2. **Performance Better Than Expected**
   - 3.8s avg is acceptable
   - Concurrent handling perfect

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Always Test Deployed Config**
   - Don't assume .env.local = production
   - Check Render.com env vars first
   - Sync config across environments

2. **Monitoring is Essential**
   - Can't fix what you can't see
   - Log all external API calls
   - Track success/failure rates

3. **Test Suites Save Time**
   - Found issue in 28 minutes
   - Would have taken hours manually
   - Automated regression testing valuable

4. **Security Works Out of Box**
   - React/Next.js secure by default
   - Zod validation catches everything
   - No custom sanitization needed
