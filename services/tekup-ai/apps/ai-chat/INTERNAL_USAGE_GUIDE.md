## üé® How to Ask Good Questions

### ‚úÖ Good Questions (Specific)

```
‚úÖ "How do I create an invoice in Billy.dk?"
‚úÖ "Show me the database schema for cleaning bookings"
‚úÖ "What's the difference between Tekup-org and Tekup-Google-AI?"
‚úÖ "Should I extract the design system from Tekup-org?"
‚úÖ "Review this TypeScript code for Tekup standards"
```

### ‚ùå Bad Questions (Too Vague)

```
‚ùå "Help me code"
‚ùå "What should I do?"
‚ùå "Fix my bug"
‚ùå "Explain everything"
```

**Tip:** Be specific about:

1. Which repository/file
2. What you're trying to do
3. What you've already tried (if debugging)

---

## üéØ Features You Should Know

### 1. Code Highlighting + Copy

When AI shows code:

- Hover over code block
- Click **Copy** button
- Paste directly into your editor
- Code is syntax-highlighted for readability

### 2. Source Citations

Every code/doc reference includes:
```
Source: Tekup-Billy/src/tools/invoices.ts (lines 45-67)
```

**Why it matters:** You can verify, learn context, see full implementation

### 3. Voice Input (Danish)

- Click microphone icon
- Speak your question in Danish
- Text appears automatically
- Great for quick questions while coding

**Browser requirement:** Chrome or Edge only

### 4. Multi-Turn Conversations

AI remembers context within a chat session:
```
Turn 1: "How do I create a booking?"
Turn 2: "How do I test it?" (AI remembers "it" = booking)
Turn 3: "What if it fails?" (AI still knows context)
```

**Tip:** Keep related questions in same chat session

### 5. Chat History

- All conversations saved
- Access past answers anytime
- Search through old chats (coming soon)
- Archive when done

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What AI Knows vs Doesn't Know

### ‚úÖ AI KNOWS

- **All Tekup repositories** (8 repos, 1,063 docs)
- **Architecture decisions** (from docs like STRATEGIC_ANALYSIS.md)
- **Code patterns** (from actual codebase)
- **Tech stack** (TypeScript, NestJS, Prisma, etc.)
- **TIER system** (repository prioritization)
- **Company conventions** (naming, structure, etc.)
- **Historical context** (why decisions were made)

### ‚ùå AI DOESN'T KNOW

- **Your local uncommitted changes**
- **Private conversations** (unless documented)
- **Customer-specific data** (not indexed for privacy)
- **Future roadmap** (unless in ROADMAP.md)
- **Your personal preferences** (unless you tell it)
- **Real-time system status** (use monitoring tools)

**Important:** AI knowledge is from **last TekupVault sync**. Recent changes (last few hours) might not be indexed yet.

---

## üîí Security & Privacy Guidelines

### ‚úÖ SAFE to Ask

- Code patterns and examples
- Architecture questions
- Technical documentation
- Strategic decisions
- Repository information
- Public API usage

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DON'T Share

- **Customer personal data** (names, emails, etc.)
- **API keys or passwords** (even in example code)
- **Production secrets** (database URLs, tokens)
- **Confidential business data** (revenue, contracts)
- **Private customer info** (unless anonymized)

**Rule of thumb:** If you wouldn't commit it to GitHub, don't put it in the chat.

---

## üìä Usage Best Practices

### For Maximum Productivity

**1. Start Your Day with AI**
```
"What should I work on today based on Tekup priorities?"
```

**2. Before Starting New Task**
```
"Show me examples of [feature] in our codebase"
```

**3. When Stuck**
```
"I'm getting [error]. Here's my code: [paste]"
```

**4. Before Making Big Decisions**
```
"Should I [action]? What are the implications?"
```

**5. For Code Review**
```
[Paste PR diff] "Review this against Tekup standards"
```

### Time-Saving Habits

- **Create templates** for common questions
- **Use voice input** for quick queries while coding
- **Archive chats** by topic (e.g., "Billy.dk Integration")
- **Share useful answers** with team (screenshot + Slack)

---

## üéì Onboarding for New Team Members

### Week 1 Recommended Flow

**Day 1: Getting Oriented**
```
1. "I'm new to Tekup. Give me an overview of our repositories"
2. "What's the TIER system?"
3. "What should I focus on as a new developer?"
```

**Day 2: Tech Stack**
```
1. "Explain our tech stack"
2. "Show me our coding standards"
3. "What testing framework do we use?"
```

**Day 3: Tekup-Billy Deep Dive**
```
1. "Explain Tekup-Billy architecture"
2. "Show me how to create an MCP tool"
3. "Where are the tests?"
```

**Day 4: First PR**
```
1. "Show me recent PRs for reference"
2. "What's a good first contribution?"
3. [After coding] "Review my code for Tekup standards"
```

**Day 5: Strategic Context**
```
1. "Why did we choose NestJS over Express?"
2. "What's the extraction plan for Tekup-org?"
3. "What are our current priorities?"
```

**Goal:** Self-service onboarding, minimal senior developer time needed

## üìû Getting Help

### If AI Gives Wrong Answer

1. **Try rephrasing** your question more specifically
2. **Provide more context** (which repo, what you tried)
3. **Ask for sources** ("Where did you get this from?")
4. **Verify in code** (use file citations to check)
5. **Report to team** if consistently wrong on a topic

### If AI Is Down

- Fallback: Use TekupVault direct search
- Escalate: Contact Jonas or DevOps

### Feature Requests

- Post in #ai-assistant Slack channel
